Emotional well-being is of paramount importance, especially during adolescence, as it profoundly influences overall mental health. To address the challenges teenagers face in effectively expressing and understanding their emotions, the Masth app was designed to offer personalized mental health support and a safe space for emotional expression.

By accurately analysing the emotions expressed in text journal entries, the system will enable users to gain insights into their emotional patterns, allowing for a deeper understanding of their mental well-being. This information can be utilized not only within the Masth app but also to enhance other features, such as a movie recommender system that suggests films based on the detected emotions. 
Additionally, the emotion detection system can be leveraged to notify the need for professional intervention, such as connecting users with a counsellor when necessary.

The Emotions dataset for NLP and Emotions in Text datasets on Kaggle have been used to train the models.
